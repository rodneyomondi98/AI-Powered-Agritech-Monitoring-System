# 📘 Interactive STEM Learning Platform: Mathematics Module

Welcome to the Interactive STEM Learning Platform! This project focuses on helping learners explore core mathematics concepts using Python-based simulations and visual tools—all implemented in Google Colab.

This specific module covers Linear Functions with hands-on graphing tools, conceptual explanations, and interactive self-assessments.

## 🔍 Project Summary

This notebook introduces students to the concept of linear functions in mathematics by combining theory, interactive graphing widgets, and a quiz. It allows learners to explore how changes in slope and intercept affect the graph of a linear equation.

## 🧮 Covered Topics

- Understanding Linear Functions: y = mx + b
- Exploring the effect of slope (m) and y-intercept (b)
- Plotting linear equations dynamically
- Interactive quiz on identifying slope

## 🚀 Technologies Used

- Python 3 (in Google Colab)
- matplotlib – for data visualization
- numpy – for numeric computations
- ipywidgets – for interactive sliders and quiz input
- Markdown (via IPython.display) – for lesson instructions and feedback

## 📂 Project Structure

The Colab Notebook includes the following components:

| Section         | Description                                          |
|----------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| 📘 Lesson Intro | Markdown-based explanation of linear functions       |
| 📊 Graphing Tool | Interactive sliders to adjust slope and intercept   |
| ✅ Quiz Section  | Auto-graded multiple-choice question to reinforce learning |
| 📈 Visualization | Real-time plotting of the function y = mx + b       |

## 📌 How to Use

1. Open the notebook in Google Colab.
2. Install dependencies if needed (ipywidgets, matplotlib, numpy).
3. Use the slope and intercept sliders to interact with the graph.
4. Read through the lesson markdown for concept explanation.
5. Complete the quiz and receive immediate feedback.

## 💡 Example

Try setting:
- Slope (m) = 2
- Intercept (b) = -3

Observe how the line shifts and tilts!

## 📚 Future Modules (Planned)

- Quadratic Functions & Parabolas
- Systems of Equations
- Geometry with Coordinate Planes
- Statistics and Probability Explorations
